    "text": "Ukraine Crisis: Trump’s Controversial Deal, Zelensky’s Resistance, and the Future of Global Geopolitics\nOn February 28, 2025, a meeting was taking place at the White House between American President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nUS Vice President J.D. Vance was also sitting on the side, along with a large media presence. Everything was being broadcast live through cameras. Behind them, White House chefs were setting plates for the meal, and amid all this, something happened that had never been seen before in modern diplomatic history.\nThe meeting turned into a heated argument—an argument so intense, it felt like a scene from a reality TV show.\nThis news taken from BBC1\nThis meeting will now be etched into the pages of history because, from this moment onward, global geopolitics and the world order are about to change.\nThe world’s richest oligarch, Elon Musk, has stated that America should withdraw from the United Nations and NATO. The US has already withdrawn from the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Agreement.\nMeanwhile, Trump’s America is growing closer to its decades-old adversary, Russia.\nThe situation has deteriorated so much that some people are outright accusing Donald Trump of being an undercover agent for Putin.\nWhat impact will all of this have on the world?\nThis meeting will now be etched into the pages of history because, from this moment onward, global geopolitics and the world order are about to change.\nThe world’s richest oligarch, Elon Musk, has stated that America should withdraw from the United Nations and NATO. The US has already withdrawn from the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Agreement.\nMeanwhile, Trump’s America is growing closer to its decades-old adversary, Russia.\nThe situation has deteriorated so much that some people are outright accusing Donald Trump of being an undercover agent for Putin.\nWhat impact will all of this have on the world?\nThis meeting will now be etched into the pages of history because, from this moment onward, global geopolitics and the world order are about to change.\nThe world’s richest oligarch, Elon Musk, has stated that America should withdraw from the United Nations and NATO. The US has already withdrawn from the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Agreement.\nMeanwhile, Trump’s America is growing closer to its decades-old adversary, Russia.\nThe situation has deteriorated so much that some people are outright accusing Donald Trump of being an undercover agent for Putin.\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. This marked the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war.\nSome people assume that since the term “war” is used, both sides must have been fighting over a third entity. But that was not the case. This was a one-sided invasion.\nUkraine went to war only to defend its country, whereas Russia went to war to seize land and resources.\nTo hide this real motive, Putin gave several excuses—sometimes claiming that NATO was expanding and posing a threat, and at other times stating that “neo-Nazis” were emerging in Ukraine and had to be eradicated.\nBut all of this was nonsense—just Russian propaganda. The real reason behind the invasion was pure colonialism.\nAt the beginning of this invasion, Russian forces advanced rapidly, capturing northern and eastern parts of Ukraine. In response, America, European nations, and several of their allies spoke out in support of Ukraine. They imposed global sanctions on Russia and began providing weapons to Ukraine.\nUkrainian forces fought bravely, and with the help of these Western allies, by September 2022, Ukraine had managed to push Russia back significantly.\nHowever, after this, the war reached a stalemate. If you look at the map, the territory controlled by Ukraine and Russia in September 2022 remains nearly the same even today, after three years of ongoing conflict. Millions of people on both sides have lost their lives."

    "text": "Trump Has Cleared that after won the election!\n\n\n\nIt is now clear that we’ve achieved the most incredible political thing, look what happened. Is this crazy?\n\n\nTrump had already stated during his election campaign that if he became president, he would end the Russia-Ukraine war in just one day.\nAnd now, he is determined to stop this war at any cost. This is the central issue of the ongoing meeting between Trump and Zelensky.\nUkraine asserts that it has no desire to continue fighting, but it needs a guarantee that if the war is halted now, Russia will not attack again after the ceasefire. For this, America must provide certain guarantees and security assurances.\nHowever, Donald Trump wants to ignore this question. Instead, he tells Ukraine: “Since we are providing you with so much money and so many weapons, you should give the U.S. 50% of your country’s natural resource revenue.”\nThis is not a joke. In reality, this is the plan that Donald Trump has proposed to Ukraine. He wants America to receive half of Ukraine’s oil, gas, contracts, ports, infrastructure, and other natural resources. BBC2\n\n\n\nThe Telegraph newspaper has described this deal as the economic colonization of Ukraine.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s demand for a $500bn (£400bn) “payback” from Ukraine goes far beyond US control over the country’s critical minerals.\nTelegraph\n\n\n\nPhotograph: US Air Force /March 4th 2025\n\n\nThe Economist magazine even stated that Trump is outright demanding protection money, just like a mafia boss. Here, extortion is taking place—“Give us half of your country’s wealth if you want our protection. Obviously, no sensible politician would agree to sell off half of their nation’s resources like this, so Zelensky refused to sign the initial agreement.\nHe stated, I will not sign something that future generations of Ukrainians will have to pay for. In response, Donald Trump became furious and publicly called Zelensky a dictator. He then took to social media and posted: Better move fast, or you won’t have a country left.\nShortly after, Zelensky went to the White House to meet with Donald Trump for further discussions on this minerals deal. This led to the February 28 meeting, which was broadcast live on camera.\nFor the first half-hour, the meeting proceeded relatively smoothly. But then, the situation began to change. Zelensky stated that Putin had violated ceasefire agreements 25 times.\nThe Economic Magazine3"

One such strategy is strategic evasion, meaning pretending to agree with Trump while actually delaying or avoiding his demands.\nVoan News4"

    "text": "A fisherman set out in his boat to catch fish.\nIt was January 2013. In Japan, a fisherman set out in his boat to catch fish. Somewhere in the sea, near a beach, he cast his fishing net into the water. After some time, while pulling out the fish trapped in his net, he found a very strange, long fish caught in it. This fish was extremely long, almost like a snake—its length was later measured to be nearly six meters. Its body was sticky and rubber-like, white in color.\nThis was not a normal fish but one that had come from the deep sea. It was a deep-sea oarfish. Generally, this fish is found nearly one kilometer deep in the ocean. The fisherman released it back into the sea because, according to Japanese folklore, the sighting of an oarfish is considered a warning sign of a disaster, especially an earthquake.\nIn 2011, a devastating earthquake struck Japan, and just before that earthquake, nearly twenty oarfish dead bodies were found on Japanese coasts. However, today, these stories are being questioned because not only in Japan but in various parts of the world, several oarfish dead bodies have been found on the shores in recent years.\nIn 2013, a fisherman caught nearly fifty oarfish at once. In 2024, oarfish were spotted three times in California. In February 2025, a live oarfish was seen in Mexico. It’s an oarfish. The repeated sightings of these fish in such a manner are truly astonishing.\nIt was only in the year 2001 that a living oarfish was filmed for the first time. But the discussion here is not just about the oarfish. Many deep-sea creatures are suddenly being spotted emerging from the depths of the ocean.\nThe Giant Phantom Jellyfish—an incredible creature whose ribbon-like tentacles can grow over ten meters long—is usually found at depths of one to two kilometers. However, in Antarctica, it was seen at a depth of just 80 meters.\nThis year, two more such incidents occurred. In Russia, fishermen caught a creature so bizarre that people started saying it looked like an alien. It was a smooth lumpfish, whose body resembled a brain.\nAdditionally, about 2,000 meters off the coast of Spain, a black sea devil (anglerfish) was spotted near the ocean’s surface. This terrifying-looking fish is literally named the “sea devil.” Both of these fish belong to the category of deep-sea creatures, which are almost never seen near the surface. Clearly, something unusual is happening."

    "text": "The question arises here—what exactly is happening?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese deep sea creatures were unknown to humans for thousands of years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are they suddenly coming to the surface now?\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 71 percent of the Earth’s surface is covered with water. We have divided this water into different oceans. 97 percent of the water found on Earth is in the five main oceans: the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Arctic Ocean, and Southern Ocean.\nAdditionally, 94 percent of the world’s wildlife is found in these oceans. But do you know something surprising? Humans have explored and mapped only 5 percent of the ocean so far. The remaining 95 percent, especially the deep sea, still remains unknown.\nWhat’s even more astonishing is that we have better maps of Mars compared to the ocean floor. And in total, twelve astronauts have spent over 300 hours in space!\n\n\n\nOn our moon, but only three people have been able to go to the deepest point of the ocean, the challenged depth, for just three hours.\n\n\nWhen you stand on a beach in Goa and look at the blue water, you are only seeing the topmost layer of the ocean. This is called the Sunlight Zone, where sunlight can reach. The wildlife in this part of the ocean is the most colorful and diverse. It is also the only layer of the ocean where photosynthesis is possible. That’s why macroalgae and phytoplankton are found here. These two living organisms form the foundation of the marine food chain.\nAdditionally, most of the creatures we typically associate with the ocean, such as whales, sharks, turtles, and dolphins, live in this zone. But as we go deeper, the light starts to fade because water absorbs sunlight.\n\nAt 10 meters deep, only 16 percent of sunlight remains.\nBy the time we reach 100 meters, only 1 percent of sunlight is left.\nAnd if we go below 1,000 meters, no sunlight can reach at all.\nThis is why it becomes extremely difficult for humans to see deeper into the ocean.\n\nHowever, just 200 meters below the surface, the second oceanic layer begins, known as the Twilight Zone. As you might know, sunlight consists of all colors, forming a complete color spectrum.\n\n\n\nBut after the sunlight zone, at a distance of two hundred meters, another zone starts which we call twilight zone.\n\n\n\nRed has the longest wavelength, while blue and violet have the shortest wavelengths.\nWater absorbs longer wavelengths first, which is why red disappears first, followed by orange, yellow, and green.\nOnly blue and violet light can reach the Twilight Zone, while all other colors vanish.\nThis is also the zone where strange creatures start to appear. One such creature is the strawberry squid—a squid that looks exactly like its name. It has one large eye and one small eye.\n\nThe large eye is adapted to look upwards, toward the light above. The small eye is adapted to see bioluminescence in the dark depths below.\nIts own color acts as a camouflage in its environment.Luciferin and luciferase—when these two chemicals mix, a chemical reaction occurs. The energy released from this reaction does not produce heat but instead is emitted in the form of light. These deep-sea creatures use this bioluminescent light either to hide themselves, to attract other organisms, or sometimes even to communicate with each other.\n\n\n\nIt takes only a few seconds for this sea angel to turn into a devil. It suddenly takes out its tentacle and weaves a web from which it is impossible to escape.\n\n\nAs soon as its stomach is full it stops glowing. Lives at a depth of six hundred to eight hundred meters.\n\n\n\nBarrel Eye Fish\n\n\nAnother truly amazing fish—its head is transparent and dome-shaped. Look at it closely. There is no other fish in the world that looks even remotely like this one. At first glance, it might seem like its eyes are the black dots above its nose. But in reality, its true eyes are the green glowing bulbs inside its head.\nOne of the most fascinating things about this fish is that its eyes can only look upward. So how does it see the food it eats? Scientists theorize that it has the ability to rotate its eyes, allowing it to spot prey from different angles.\nThis fish truly seems like something straight out of alien technology—a living submarine with a 360-degree rotating telescope inside a transparent dome.\nIf you go even deeper into the ocean, you will encounter something terrifying—the giant squid. Giant squids can grow up to 13 meters long, which is the size of a two-story house. Their eyes are massive, measuring 25–30 centimeters in diameter—as big as a basketball. These are the largest eyes found in any animal on Earth, perfectly adapted to detect prey in the pitch-black depths of the ocean.\n\n\n\nLike deep-sea anglerfish, including the Black Sea Devil. The first time an anglerfish was popularized was in the movie Finding Nemo.\n\n\nIf you remember this animation, these fish have a fishing pole-like structure on their heads with a glowing bulb attached. They use this bioluminescent lure to attract prey in the dark waters. This was also shown in the film, Finding Nemo. However, what the film didn’t show—and what is truly bizarre about anglerfish—is their reproduction strategy.\n Male anglerfish are ten times smaller than females, and their only purpose in life is to reproduce. When a male finds a female, he attaches himself to her body—and by “attaches,” it literally means he merges with her.\nTheir bodies fuse together, and they share the same bloodstream. Over time, the male essentially becomes a part of the female’s body, functioning like one of her organs.\nFemales can even collect multiple male partners for reproduction. In fact, a single female can have six to eight males attached to her body at once. Hearing all this, you can probably imagine—while life on land follows certain familiar rules, the deep sea has an entirely different story of its own."
