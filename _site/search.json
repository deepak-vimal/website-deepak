    "text": "Ukraine Crisis: Trump’s Controversial Deal, Zelensky’s Resistance, and the Future of Global Geopolitics\nOn February 28, 2025, a meeting was taking place at the White House between American President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nUS Vice President J.D. Vance was also sitting on the side, along with a large media presence. Everything was being broadcast live through cameras. Behind them, White House chefs were setting plates for the meal, and amid all this, something happened that had never been seen before in modern diplomatic history.\nThe meeting turned into a heated argument—an argument so intense, it felt like a scene from a reality TV show.\nThis news taken from BBC1\nThis meeting will now be etched into the pages of history because, from this moment onward, global geopolitics and the world order are about to change.\nThe world’s richest oligarch, Elon Musk, has stated that America should withdraw from the United Nations and NATO. The US has already withdrawn from the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Agreement.\nMeanwhile, Trump’s America is growing closer to its decades-old adversary, Russia.\nThe situation has deteriorated so much that some people are outright accusing Donald Trump of being an undercover agent for Putin.\nWhat impact will all of this have on the world?\nThis meeting will now be etched into the pages of history because, from this moment onward, global geopolitics and the world order are about to change.\nThe world’s richest oligarch, Elon Musk, has stated that America should withdraw from the United Nations and NATO. The US has already withdrawn from the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Agreement.\nMeanwhile, Trump’s America is growing closer to its decades-old adversary, Russia.\nThe situation has deteriorated so much that some people are outright accusing Donald Trump of being an undercover agent for Putin.\nWhat impact will all of this have on the world?\nThis meeting will now be etched into the pages of history because, from this moment onward, global geopolitics and the world order are about to change.\nThe world’s richest oligarch, Elon Musk, has stated that America should withdraw from the United Nations and NATO. The US has already withdrawn from the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Agreement.\nMeanwhile, Trump’s America is growing closer to its decades-old adversary, Russia.\nThe situation has deteriorated so much that some people are outright accusing Donald Trump of being an undercover agent for Putin.\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. This marked the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war.\nSome people assume that since the term “war” is used, both sides must have been fighting over a third entity. But that was not the case. This was a one-sided invasion.\nUkraine went to war only to defend its country, whereas Russia went to war to seize land and resources.\nTo hide this real motive, Putin gave several excuses—sometimes claiming that NATO was expanding and posing a threat, and at other times stating that “neo-Nazis” were emerging in Ukraine and had to be eradicated.\nBut all of this was nonsense—just Russian propaganda. The real reason behind the invasion was pure colonialism.\nAt the beginning of this invasion, Russian forces advanced rapidly, capturing northern and eastern parts of Ukraine. In response, America, European nations, and several of their allies spoke out in support of Ukraine. They imposed global sanctions on Russia and began providing weapons to Ukraine.\nUkrainian forces fought bravely, and with the help of these Western allies, by September 2022, Ukraine had managed to push Russia back significantly.\nHowever, after this, the war reached a stalemate. If you look at the map, the territory controlled by Ukraine and Russia in September 2022 remains nearly the same even today, after three years of ongoing conflict. Millions of people on both sides have lost their lives."

    "text": "Trump Has Cleared that after won the election!\n\n\n\nIt is now clear that we’ve achieved the most incredible political thing, look what happened. Is this crazy?\n\n\nTrump had already stated during his election campaign that if he became president, he would end the Russia-Ukraine war in just one day.\nAnd now, he is determined to stop this war at any cost. This is the central issue of the ongoing meeting between Trump and Zelensky.\nUkraine asserts that it has no desire to continue fighting, but it needs a guarantee that if the war is halted now, Russia will not attack again after the ceasefire. For this, America must provide certain guarantees and security assurances.\nHowever, Donald Trump wants to ignore this question. Instead, he tells Ukraine: “Since we are providing you with so much money and so many weapons, you should give the U.S. 50% of your country’s natural resource revenue.”\nThis is not a joke. In reality, this is the plan that Donald Trump has proposed to Ukraine. He wants America to receive half of Ukraine’s oil, gas, contracts, ports, infrastructure, and other natural resources. BBC2\n\n\n\nThe Telegraph newspaper has described this deal as the economic colonization of Ukraine.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s demand for a $500bn (£400bn) “payback” from Ukraine goes far beyond US control over the country’s critical minerals.\nTelegraph\n\n\n\nPhotograph: US Air Force /March 4th 2025\n\n\nThe Economist magazine even stated that Trump is outright demanding protection money, just like a mafia boss. Here, extortion is taking place—“Give us half of your country’s wealth if you want our protection. Obviously, no sensible politician would agree to sell off half of their nation’s resources like this, so Zelensky refused to sign the initial agreement.\nHe stated, I will not sign something that future generations of Ukrainians will have to pay for. In response, Donald Trump became furious and publicly called Zelensky a dictator. He then took to social media and posted: Better move fast, or you won’t have a country left.\nShortly after, Zelensky went to the White House to meet with Donald Trump for further discussions on this minerals deal. This led to the February 28 meeting, which was broadcast live on camera.\nFor the first half-hour, the meeting proceeded relatively smoothly. But then, the situation began to change. Zelensky stated that Putin had violated ceasefire agreements 25 times.\nThe Economic Magazine3"

If a country does not comply, there are discussions about imposing tariffs on them.\nThe long-term damage this will cause to the USA is very clear. When other countries see that the U.S. is treating them this way, it will lead to unity among them.\nThe Hindu"

A new consensus is emerging in Europe—Europe can no longer depend on the USA.\n\n\n\nEU leaders vow to ramp up funding to defend their countries, Ukraine\n\n\nThere are calls for boycotting American companies, and discussions are taking place about creating a European Union-wide army to reduce reliance on the U.S.\nSome countries are also devising new strategies to tolerate Trump’s actions. One such strategy is strategic evasion, meaning pretending to agree with Trump while actually delaying or avoiding his demands.\nVoan News4"

But today, America’s relevance is fading.\nThis is creating a geopolitical vacuum—Who will lead these international institutions? There is a need for strong nations to take on leadership roles because the world cannot function under constant bullying."

It can establish diverse economic partnerships with Asian, African, and South American countries."
